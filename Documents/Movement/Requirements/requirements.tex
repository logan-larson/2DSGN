\section{Grounded Movement}

    \subsection*{Lateral Movement}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Move \emph{left} or \emph{right} relative to body orientation
            when movement input is pressed
        \item Accelerate relative to acceleration variable
        \item Limit top-speed to set amount
        \item On key release, apply friction to reduce speed
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Sprinting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When sprint input is held, increase top speed by sprint multiplier
        \item On release, don't apply sprint multiplier
        \item Sprinting is only allowed in parkour mode
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Grounded orientation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When \emph{grounded}, match player orientation to surface below's
            normal vector
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \emph{Grounded} is a property that returns true when the
                    player is within a height threshold above the ground
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Grounded height above ground}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When grounded, set height above ground to certain amount
    \end{itemize}

\section{Player State}
    \subsection*{Parkour mode}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Player is quadrupedal
        \item Increased movement speed
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Combat mode}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Player is bipedal
        \item Reduced movement speed
        \item Other functionality will be added, but it is irrelevant at the time
    \end{itemize}

\section{Jumping}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item On jump key press, grounded is false
        \item On jump key press, impulse force is added to player movement in
            direction of cursor
        \item If cursor direction is between 180\degree{} and 360\degree{}
            relative to the player body, no jump is performed
        \item Jumping can only be performed in \emph{Parkour mode}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If in combat mode, switch to parkour mode then perform jump
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\section{Airborne Movement}
    \subsection*{Landing prediction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When in air, use projectile motion physics to predict landing spot
        \item With known landing spot, rotate player body to match surface
            normal of landing spot
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Forces applied}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Movement mechanic will be added during combat
        \item Must allow for forces to be applied to player while airborne
    \end{itemize}

\section{Animations}
    \subsection*{Body orientation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Orient body based on horizontal directional input
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Head orientation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Orient head toward cursor
        \item Once head breaks the vertical plane relative to the player up
            direction, vertically mirror it, so that the head doesn't perform
            unnatural rotations
    \end{itemize}
