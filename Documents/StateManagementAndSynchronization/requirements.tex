\section{Client actions}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Multiple clients connect to a local server
    \begin{itemize}
		    \item Server logs show client connected
    \end{itemize}
		\item Multiple clients connect to the remote test server
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Server logs show client connected
    \end{itemize}
	  \item Client inputs are sent to the server
    \begin{itemize}
				\item When input events that affect the game state are triggered, the input is sent to the server
				\item Server logs show data transferred by each client
    \end{itemize}
		\item Client predicts game state based on user input
    \begin{itemize}
				\item When input events that affect the game state are triggered, the client uses the input to predict the game state
				\item Without server responses, the game's movement functions properly
    \end{itemize}
		\item Client reconciles predicted state with authoritative server state
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Client receives server game state on server tick
				\item Client compares client game state to server game state for time stamp in past
				\item If not matching, client game state gets overridden to  match server game state
    \end{itemize}
		\item Client interpolates entity positions given the game states provided by the server
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Client receives server game state on server tick
				\item Client interpolates from client game state to server game state to reduce jitter
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Server actions}
\begin{itemize}
		\item When a client connects, a player is spawned for the corresponding client
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Server receives client connection
				\item Server spawns client object into server game state
    \end{itemize}
		\item Server determines game state based on clients' inputs
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Server receives client input event
				\item Server determines game state based on input and timestamps it
    \end{itemize}
		\item Server sends updated game state to all clients at regular intervals
		\item When a client disconnects, their player is removed
    \begin{itemize}
			  \item Server receives client disconnection
				\item Server removes client object from server game state
    \end{itemize}
		\item Server compensates authoritative state for client latency
    \begin{itemize}
				\item Server receives client input
				\item Server compares input to server game state when client input was performed
				\item Server updates game state to match client's expected results of game state based on inputs
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Environment}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Set up a local test server
		\item Set up a persistent remote test server
\end{itemize}
